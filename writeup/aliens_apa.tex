\section{Introduction}

Children learn much important information through explicit instruction (e.g., ``put the fork on the left of the plate'') and generic statements (``forks go on the left''), but not all information is stated directly. Sometimes information is implicit in the particular production choices a speaker makes. For example, if a parent says, ``that's a salad fork,'' she is implicitly conveying that forks vary in the foods they are intended for (and perhaps that most other forks are likely used for non-salad items). More generally, the way we describe the world can reveal to a perceptive observer all sorts of biases about what we find notable, interesting, or worthy of comment---and such biases in turn reflect our views of how the world is structured. Are children able to use these implicit signals for learning? 

We address this question using a simple case study: learning to generalize novel words via minimal contrastive descriptions.  We focus on contrastive word choices, as in the above ``salad fork'' example. Contrastive word choices---the way we use labels and their modifiers---can help identify the speaker's intended referent in the current context (selecting the desired fork) but can also jointly signal generalizable knowledge (forks are associated with meal courses). In the current study, we investigate the idea that adults and children may learn generalizable knowledge via inferences about why speakers choose a particular word to convey a message. To motivate this case study, we begin by discussing two bodies of research: first, work on children's ability to learn about the world from explicit statements, and second, work on their ability to reason about the implicit knowledge and beliefs underlying other agents' actions (both non-linguistic and linguistic). 

% This work motivates our current studies: Three experiments investigating preschoolers' generalizations about unseen category members based on speakers' word choices. 

\subsection{Learning from others' explicit statements}

Although learning from the world directly is a very powerful method for acquiring knowledge \cite{gopnik2012b}, there is no way that even the most precocious child-scientist could reconstruct an adult's knowledge from direct experience alone \cite{shafto2012,harris2012}. Instead, children's knowledge comes from a mixture of direct experiences and knowledge transmitted by others. 

Language is an extremely powerful source of cues about the world. From the time children begin to speak, they understand that language is used to communicate information \cite{vouloumanos2012,martin2012}. They expect speakers of the same language to use conventional names for conventional meanings \cite{clark1987, markman1988, diesendruck2005}, but learn to recognize that individual knowledge such as facts about objects may not be shared \cite{diesendruck2001}. They also show early knowledge that language can share information that goes beyond the here-and-now \cite{saylor2007,ganea2007}. This early, foundational set of assumptions---that speakers use language in consistent and communicative ways to convey (relatively) abstract knowledge---is critical in allowing children to use language to learn about the world. 

While some language describes the current state of the world (e.g., ``the salad fork is on the outside''), other statements provide more general information that applies across situations (``salad forks go on the outside''). Generic language---cued in a number of ways, including the use of a bare plural (e.g. ``salad forks'')---is a particularly powerful method for conveying such information \cite{leslie2008}. Children can use generic language to infer general properties quite early \cite{gelman2003}. They draw different conclusions from generic statements than non-generic statements, and are more likely to believe that information stated generically is  conceptually and functionally central and more widely-known \cite{cimpian2009, cimpian2010, cimpian2012}. And in some contexts, generic language is not even necessary: The simple use of a label or even the use of particular communicative cues---child-directed speech, direct gaze, or pointing---may signal that a speaker is presenting information that is relevant to a kind, category, or practice \cite{csibra2009, butler2012}. 
% One striking example of the role of labeling comes from a study in which \citeA{rakoczy2008} introduced 2- and 3-year-old children to a game featuring an action called ``daxing.'' Children then saw a character perform a different action and label it daxing or not.  Both age groups were more likely to protest the new action when it violated their expectations about the meaning of daxing than when it was unlabeled. By age 3 children were more likely to provide explicitly normative protests (e.g. ``It doesn't go like that'') than imperative protests (e.g. ``Use the stick''). Providing a label for the action led children to expect and enforce that the action was specific and inflexible to other interpretations.  

Language is such a powerful source of information that preschoolers find it very difficult \emph{not} to believe what they are told.  Three-year-olds can discount inconsistent evidence conveyed through physical markers (e.g. they can learn that an agent purposely places a sticker on the wrong cup, and select the opposite), but they have a much harder time discounting verbal evidence from an unreliable speaker in the same scenario: Even after learning that the agent consistently states the \emph{wrong} location, children still look for the hidden item where the speaker says \cite{jaswal2010}.  When given the option to choose between two potential informants, however, preschoolers can recognize which speaker is more accurate and prefer to trust that speaker \cite{pasquini2007}, retaining this preference even after a time delay \cite{corriveau2009}.  In sum, children favor more reliable speakers when a choice is available, but they display a general bias to trust verbal information.





% To summarize: Explicit linguistic transmission is a powerful and important source of general information about both the specific and the abstract. From an early age children are able to make use of this information, recognizing a number of different cues to the generalizability of the information in a particular statement. We next turn to work on children's ability to make inferences about the unseen causes of actions, both linguistic and non-linguistic.


\subsection{Learning from the knowledge implicit in others' actions}

% Our work is based on the idea that children make rational inferences about people√ïs actions.  

In nearly all of the work reviewed above, a parent, teacher, or experimenter presents the relevant information explicitly, via a demonstration or explicit utterance. But a parallel line of work suggests that children and even infants are able to make inferences about the \emph{implicit} sources of both linguistic and non-linguistic actions. This literature is critical for motivating our hypothesis---that such inferences might not just inform guesses about particular agents' knowledge, abilities, preferences, or desires, but that they might also be a source of information about the world more generally. 

% We begin by discussing work on non-linguistic actions and then move on to linguistic (pragmatic) inferences.

% \subsubsection{Inferences about others' non-linguistic actions}

By their first birthday, babies appear to make inferences about the unseen goals that underlie actions, even in very stripped-down displays.  For example, they look longer when a shape that previously jumped over a wall toward another shape continues on the same path when the wall is removed (an action goal) instead of moving directly toward the shape (an end-state goal; \citeNP{gergely1995}). This result is part of a broader body of work suggesting that infants expect agents to act rationally to achieve their goals in the most efficient way \cite{csibra1998, gergely2003}. In other words, very young children appear sensitive not only to agents' particular actions, but also to the presumed purpose for these actions. 

Young children also seem to be able to integrate information about constraints on knowledge and action into their inferences about goals. For example, infants can distinguish between actions that are produced intentionally (e.g. the choice of a particular ball by an agent viewing the contents of a box) versus randomly (by an agent wearing a blindfold; \citeNP{xu2009}).  They can also reevaluate the likelihood of particular evidence when physical constraints make it more difficult for certain items to be selected (e.g., balls that stick to velcro, \citeNP{denison2010b}).  They can even infer that an agent demonstrates a preference by observing a pattern of choices that would be unlikely to occur by random selection \cite{kushnir2010}. 

Critical for our hypothesis here, some evidence suggests that young children can also work backwards from agents' actions to infer generalizable knowledge about objects. In an experiment by \citeA{gweon2010}, fifteen-month-olds watched an experimenter pull a series of blue balls from a box and squeeze each toy to produce a squeaking sound. Babies were then handed a slightly different, yellow ball, and their generalizations about whether the new ball should also squeak were measured by their attempts to squeeze the toy. Depending on the evidence they saw, babies made different generalizations: If the blue balls were sampled by the experimenter from a box of mostly blue balls (implying that they were randomly sampled by the agent), they were more likely to think that a yellow ball would also squeak. But if they saw the blue balls picked out from a box of mostly yellow balls (where presumably the blue balls were less likely to be picked randomly, and thus were more likely to be intentionally selected for the demonstration of squeaking), they thought the yellow balls were less likely to squeak. In other words, children in this second condition made a general inference about the world (yellow balls don't squeak) based on a surprising thing that someone \emph{didn't} do (did not pick out the more common, yellow balls). 
% The experiments we present below test a related type of inference in the linguistic domain; we therefore describe some of the background for these kinds of pragmatic inference. 

% The inferences described above show a striking similarity to a quite different kind of inference: pragmatic inferences in language comprehension 

Similar to the patterns of reasoning described above, listeners make pragmatic inferences in language comprehension by reasoning about the generating causes of a speaker's (linguistic) action and about the constraints on that action \cite{shafto2012}. Grice's \citeyear{grice1975} maxims of cooperative communication---be truthful, informative, relevant, and clear---provide a framework for inferring implied meaning from linguistic evidence. For instance, Grice gives an example of a recommender who declares that his student has good penmanship. This recommender is choosing an action that completes his goal---write a letter that is maximally informative about the student---while complying with the restrictions on his actions---be truthful, don't say anything negative. On the basis of the above letter of recommendation, a reader of the letter can make the \emph{implicature} that the writer does not believe the applicant has any other positive qualities (or else he would have mentioned them). A number of other theories have also attempted to describe the interplay between intention and production, all preserving the basic idea of pragmatic inference as action understanding \cite{horn1984,clark1996,levinson2000}. 

Just as babies form expectations about sampling likelihoods and infer that violations are intentional and informative (e.g. indicating others' preference or pedagogical demonstrations), children may learn to do the same for language, and make inferences about implicit, intended meaning when speakers' production choices differ from their expectations. While a substantial literature has investigated the specifics of children's pragmatic inference \cite<e.g.>{barner2011,katsos2011}, the general consensus is that children's language learning broadly respects pragmatic principles \cite<see e.g.,>{bloom2002,clark2010,frank2014}.
 % In our current work we examine children's ability to mkae

% In our current work, we take the simple case of modified referents to examine whether listeners infer that the decision to include an optional grammatical marker (the adjective) pragmatically conveys a speaker's intention to mark a relevant contrast dimension.

%Since we are interested here in whether children can learn based on pragmatic inferences, we briefly review work on children's general pragmatic abilities. Initial work in this domain suggested that children might show deficits in pragmatic language understanding through age five or even later \cite{noveck2000,papafragou2003}. When presented with a situation where three of three horses jumped a fence, children judged the utterance ``some of the horses jumped over the fence'' to be a felicitous description. While adults reject the statement under the assumption that ``some'' implies \emph{some but not all}, children accept that ``some'' can overlap in meaning with ``all''.  A more recent body of work, however, suggests that these deficits are specific to particular linguistic phenomena, namely scalar implicatures using quantifiers like ``some'' and ``all'' \cite{barner2011,katsos2011}.

%One interpretation of failures in scalar implicature tasks is that children have trouble holding in mind and contrasting the alternative statements ``some'' and ``all.'' This \emph{alternatives hypothesis} makes a number of predictions that have now been tested. First, children have difficulties with even non-pragmatic interpretations that require considering these alternatives (e.g., reasoning about what ``only some'' means; \citeNP{chierchia2001, barner2011}). Second, exposure to alternatives increases their success in computing implicatures \cite{skordos2014}. Third, they perform better in contexts where alternative meanings are more explicit (e.g. pictured as alternatives in a forced-choice) \cite{miller2005,stiller2014}. Thus, children appear to be more pragmatically sophisticated than the original results suggested. We appeal to the alternatives hypothesis below in describing the developmental pattern we observe in our experiments. 

\subsection{Our current study}

Given that children are able to make sophisticated inferences about the basis for both actions and utterances, we ask whether pragmatic inferences can provide a method for the transmission of information. We investigate preschoolers' ability to infer information about a general class from the specific word choices that a speaker makes in a description. For example, labeling a novel item as a ``tall zib'' conveys not only that this item is a tall zib, but also suggests that height is a relevant property for zibs and perhaps even that other zibs may be shorter.   

We focus on adjectives as a case study.  Because adjectives are optional modifiers, they can be included selectively in an utterance to draw contrasts between an intended referent and other unintended alternatives. Preschoolers show sensitivity to implicit contrast information conveyed by prenominal adjectives (both familiar and novel), and infer that a modified referent picks out a contrast within a category set (e.g. ``the red one'' implies a red butterfly rather than red ball when another butterfly is present), but a bare referent (e.g. ``the butterfly,'' among this set) does not necessarily imply a particular target \cite{gelman1985}. Children use prenominal adjectives to disambiguate referential targets in their real-time language comprehension by age 3 \cite{fernald2010}, and in more complex visual contexts by kindergarten \cite{nadig2002}. 

While previous work has focused on how adjectives are used to identify targets in referential communication tasks, here we examine a novel question. We ask whether adjective use can help listeners infer \emph{what the context is} that would lead a speaker to produce a partiular modified description. We assess the hypothesis that children can infer that a contrastive description conveys not only information about the current referent, but also information about the property of other category members; we refer to these as ``contrast inferences.'' 

In the four experiments below, we tested this hypothesis. In Experiment 1, we found that with a very supportive framing that encouraged them to consider an adjective as contrastive, preschoolers made robust inferences about categories that were consistent with our hypothesis. When we removed some of these contrastive cues in Experiment 2, performance decreased but was somewhat higher with pre-exposure to the appropriate alternative set; these findings provide support for a pragmatic interpretation of contrast inferences. Experiment 3 replicated children's performance in the less-supportive context and ruled out an alternative explanation regarding marked feature dimensions. Finally, in Experiment 4, children succeeded in making contrast inferences in a more open-ended production task, suggesting that they were able to summon to mind the relevant contrast dimension and not just select between visually-presented alternatives. 



\section{Experiment 1}


To investigate preschoolers' inferences about adjective use and category membership, we used a simple triad task.  We introduced children to a novel shape, followed by two similar shapes: one that differed from the first only by size (e.g. tall versus short), and the other that differed from the first only by a different polar feature (e.g. dirty versus clean).\footnote{In discussions of adjective semantics, the size adjectives we used are referred to as \emph{gradable} adjectives because their meaning is relative to the head noun \cite{kennedy2012}---a small sofa is nevertheless bigger than a large mouse. In contrast, our alternative features were \emph{non-gradable}---a sofa or a mouse exposed to water is equally considered wet. For convenience here and below, we refer to this distinction as ``size'' vs. ``feature.''} We marked the first shape using either a prenominal size or feature adjective (focused contrastively in its prosody). We then asked children to generalize what they thought other category members usually looked like. 

Children could follow at least two plausible strategies in this scenario. First, they could generalize by matching the exact property they heard, reasoning as follows: \emph{You said that this zib was tall, so most zibs are probably also tall}. Second, they could generalize from the property \emph{dimension} they heard, reasoning instead that: \emph{You pointed out that this zib is tall. If most zibs were tall, you probably wouldn't have marked this one's size. So other zibs probably vary by height and can be short.} If children are sensitive to the pragmatic implications of speakers' choices, then they should take the latter route and infer that opting to include an adjective conveys an implied contrast with a set of alternatives, in this case other category members. Note that while in principle the use of a particular adjective only licenses an inference that that property is notable (and thus the category likely \emph{varies} on that dimension), our use of prosody and the question about other exemplars' usual appearance all were intended to bias children to choose the \emph{opposite} to the named property.


% In our first set of experiments, we found that adults consistently made contrast inferences from adjective use, while preschoolers gained sensitivity to how speakers mark relevant property information with age.  They may begin by appreciating that scalar opposites are paired, and that use of one term (e.g. \emph{wet}) implies contrast with its opposite (i.e. \emph{dry}). 

% In Experiment 1, we provided a supportive scaffolding to help children recognize that adjectives were being used contrastively: We told them explicitly that ``This is a special kind of zib.'' 








%In Experiment 2, we removed the contrastive ``special kind of'' framing to test whether the older children (who succeeded handily in Experiment 1) could make contrast inferences based on the presence of a prosodically-focused adjective alone. Our revised framing was ``This is a zib. This is a tall zib.'' We hypothesized that this \emph{adjective only} condition would make the contrast inference substantially more difficult. 

%Previous work on pragmatic inference has suggested that one major problem for preschool children in making inferences about contrasting terms is summoning to mind alternative word choices that could have been used (e.g. that ``some'' is a weaker alternative to ``all''; \citeNP{barner2011}). For this reason, we attempted to alleviate this burden in our task by providing children with pre-training on the relevant contrasts used at test. In this \emph{Alternatives Pre-Exposure} condition, we read children a book highlighting the polar opposite terms prior to the experimental task to remind children that, for example, ``dirty'' is an alternative to ``clean.'' We predicted that the increased experience comparing adjective alternatives in this condition would help support children's ability to make contrast inferences at test.


\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

We recruited a planned sample of 48 children from a university preschool into two age groups: 4.0--4.5 years (n=24, mean age 4;4, 12 girls, 12 boys) and 4.5--5.0 years (n=24, mean age 4;8, 15 girls, 9 boys). The preschool is an English language school, and children included in the sample were fluent speakers of English. Two children were excluded for not completing all four trials of the task.



%Because of the presumed increased difficulty of this task, we recruited children from the older age groups: 4.0--4.5 years (n=48, mean age 4;4, 24 girls, 24 boys) and 4.5---5.0 years (n=48, mean age 4;9, 25 girls, 23 boys).  Half of the children in each age group (24 younger 4s and 24 older 4s, represented evenly across gender) were randomly assigned to each of the conditions (\emph{Adjective Only} and \emph{Alternatives Pre-Exposure}). Four children were excluded for not completing all four trials of the task. 


We also recruited a comparison group of 128 adult participants through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) online crowd-sourcing service.  Participants all reported being native English speakers and residents of the United States. They were informed that the task was designed for children. Seven participants were excluded for failing to complete the task.

    \caption{\label{fig:inanimate_demo} Example test trial. Participants were introduced to an induction example (top) described with either a feature or size adjective. They were then shown two images, one that differed from the induction example by a feature contrast (e.g. dirty versus clean, left) and one that differed by a size contrast (e.g. tall versus short, right), and were asked to point to which picture they thought category members typically look like. In Experiment 3, contrastive framing (``This is a special kind of zib.'') was included before the modified reference. } 
  \end{center} 
\vspace{-10ex}
\end{figure}	

We constructed the experiment as a storybook, illustrated with colorful clipart images. The book contained two training trials and four test trials. Each test trial consisted of a novel shape (induction example) along with a pair of generalization stimuli: one that differed from the induction example only by size (e.g. tall versus short), and one image that differed from the example only by a feature contrast (e.g., dirty versus clean; see example in Figure \ref{fig:inanimate_demo}). Two of the four test trials used size adjectives and two of the trials used feature adjectives. Size terms were \emph{small} (vs. big), \emph{long} (vs. short), \emph{tall} (vs. short), and \emph{short} (vs. long);  feature contrasts were \emph{broken} (vs. unbroken), \emph{pointy} (vs. smooth), \emph{dirty} (vs. clean), and \emph{wet} (vs. dry).  To ensure that children were familiar with the words we used, we included a posttest of two-alternative displays.  Children were able to recognize all of the contrasts used in our task, with 96\% for 4.0--4.5 year-olds and 98\% for 4.5--5.0 year-olds.  





\subsubsection{Procedure}



The experimenter read the storybook with children individually in a quiet room at their preschool. To begin the book, children were introduced to a character named Allen the Alien who was visiting planet Earth.  They then participated in two training trials containing familiar items to teach Allen about some things on Earth and get children used to the study design.  Training trials featured adjectives other than those used in test trials, and training pictures displayed only one relevant contrast choice.  For example, children were shown a picture of chocolate milk followed by two pictures, one of plain milk and one of orange juice. Children were told, ``This is milk. This is \emph{chocolate} milk.  What does milk usually look like?  What does most milk look like?'' and prompted to point to the picture.\footnote{Our training examples are framed around identifying a prototypical case of a noun category in order to help children understand that the goal of our task is to find what members of a category usually look like. Although we expect children to comprehend \emph{most} and \emph{usually} at the ages we tested \cite{halberda2008}, the training trials were intended to  help illustrate this relationship further.}
On the rare occasion that children answered incorrectly, the experimenter repeated the statements and encouraged children until they answered correctly.  

After the training trials, children participated in four test trials.  For each test trial, children were shown a picture of an induction example and told something about it, e.g. ``This is a zib. This is a tall zib.''  They were then shown two similar pictures, one that differed from the exemplar only by the target feature dimension (e.g., a tall clean zib) and one that differed from the exemplar only by size (e.g., a short dirty zib), and were asked ``What do you think zibs usually look like?  What do you think most zibs look like?'' 

Participants were assigned to one of two lists, counterbalanced for adjective type and picture order.  Adjectives were focused using contrastive stress. The experimenter sat next to the child and avoiding gaze cues while children pointed to their selections.  Responses were coded online and double-coded offline using a video recording of the testing session.  The task took about ten minutes to complete. 

The task was adapted to an online format for adult participants. They viewed a single trial composed of one of the picture triads and read the same text that was spoken to children. We used only a single trial for adults to avoid inducing task demands caused by repeating the same type of inference \cite{frank2012}. Picture type, side, and adjective were counterbalanced across participants.  Adults indicated their response using a radio button below their image selection and were paid 25 cents for completing the task, which took about two minutes.

Inferring a dimension of contrast from a single adjective cue was challenging for children. We categorized a response as correct---representing what we will call a \emph{contrast inference}---if participants selected the item that differed from the exemplar along the referenced dimension (e.g., they chose the short item if the exemplar was referred as ``tall,'' and the clean item if it was described as ``dirty'').  Contrast selections in size trials were especially low, while contrast judgements in feature trials remained higher. Averaging across adjective types, 4.0-year-olds were not above chance ($t(22) = 1.10$, $p = .28$), but 4.5-year-olds were ($t(23)=2.18$, $p = .04$)\footnote{Raw data and analysis code can be found at REMOVED FOR BLIND REVIEW.}. Breaking performance down by adjective type, on feature trials the younger 4s were marginally above chance, while the older 4s were substantially above chance ($t(22) = 1.82$, $p = .08$ and $t(23)=3.71$, $p = .001$). Both groups' performance did not differ from chance for size adjectives. Overall, the task was difficult but the oldest children could make contrast inferences at above-chance levels for feature adjectives. 


A possible explanation for these findings is that contrast inferences were in fact not warranted by the subtle cue of a single adjective. Ruling out this explanation, adults were near ceiling at making contrast selections for both feature and size terms in this task. These findings indicate that prenominal adjective use is a strong cue to contrast for mature listeners, and children's sensitivity to the implications of these descriptive choices is still developing.



%One possible explanation for these findings is that contrast inferences were in fact not warranted by the simpler adjective framing in this experiment. Ruling out this explanation, the performance of adults in Experiment 2 (without supportive language) was essentially identical to that of adults in Experiment 1. Adults' robust contrast inferences even in the Adjectives Only framing indicate that prenominal adjective use is a strong cue to contrast for mature listeners, and children's sensitivity to the implications of these descriptive choices is still developing.

% (rather than being warranted but simply not being identified by children)
%included a significant negative coefficient on size adjectives ($\beta = -1.08$, $p < .0001$) and marginal effects of age and book type ($\beta = 1.04$, $p = .07$ and $\beta = .50$, $p = .09$, respectively). 

%In sum, Experiment 2 provides support for the hypothesis that children's judgments in Experiment 1 were strengthened by the presence of the contrastive language ``a special kind of.'' When we removed this supportive phrase, performance dropped markedly, especially for size adjectives (which might not be as clearly contrastive as feature adjectives). Nevertheless, performance was still above chance for older children in some trial types, suggesting that this inference was still possible for them.  We also saw some signs that pre-exposure to a storybook that used the target adjectives contrastively improved performance, providing additional support to the idea that increasing the recognition of pragmatic contrasts helped children to make the appropriate generalization. 

For children, a potential source of the asymmetry between feature and size adjectives could be due to the relatively greater contrast implied by our featural adjectives. Saying that something is ``dirty'' almost always implies a changed state from having been clean at another point in time. In contrast, saying something is ``tall'' can imply that there are shorter others---but it can also simply reflect some sort of general, stable comment on height. If this ambiguity about the contrastiveness of the size adjectives was the source of the low performance in this task, familiarizing children with opposite pairs used in the task might help them better make contrast inferences for these terms at test. In Experiment 2, we included an Alternatives Pre-Exposure book before the task to examine whether it might increase performance for size adjectives by virtue of highlighting the contrastive use of alternative size terms. 

%the Adjective Only condition, the Alternatives Pre-Exposure condition might increase performance for size adjectives by virtue of highlighting the contrastive use of alternative size terms. 


% Thus, we believe that the contrastive framing in Experiment 1 helped children differentially in interpreting the contrast inference implied by the use of the adjective features. It appears that children can recognize that prenominal adjectives imply FIXME

\section{Experiment 2}

Previous work on pragmatic inference has suggested that one major problem for preschool children in making inferences about contrasting terms is summoning to mind alternative word choices that could have been used (e.g. that ``some'' is a weaker alternative to ``all''; \citeNP{barner2011}). For this reason, we attempted to alleviate this burden in our task by providing children with pre-training on the relevant contrasts used at test. In Experiment 2, we reran the same procedure as in Experiment 1 but preceded the task with a 
%In this \emph{Alternatives Pre-Exposure} condition, we read children a 
book highlighting the polar opposite terms used at test to remind children that, for example, ``dirty'' is an alternative to ``clean.'' We predicted that the increased experience comparing adjective alternatives in this condition would help support children's ability to make contrast inferences at test.

We recruited a new sample of 48 children from the same university preschool into two age groups: 4.0--4.5 years (n=24, mean age 4;4, 12 girls, 12 boys) and 4.5--5.0 years (n=24, mean age 4;8, 11 girls, 13 boys). Two children were excluded for not completing all four trials of the task.

%Because of the presumed increased difficulty of this task, we recruited children from the older age groups: 4.0--4.5 years (n=48, mean age 4;4, 24 girls, 24 boys) and 4.5---5.0 years (n=48, mean age 4;9, 25 girls, 23 boys).  Half of the children in each age group (24 younger 4s and 24 older 4s, represented evenly across gender) were randomly assigned to each of the conditions (\emph{Adjective Only} and \emph{Alternatives Pre-Exposure}). Four children were excluded for not completing all four trials of the task. 

%We also ran a group of 128 adult participants on MTurk.  All participants were reported to be US residents and native English speakers.  They were informed that the task was designed for children. Seven were excluded for failing to complete the task. 

\subsubsection{Materials}

Stimuli were identical to Experiment 1. For the Alternatives Pre-Exposure, participants read a book prior to the testing procedure with clip art images of familiar items depicting the same size and feature contrasts terms portrayed in the test book. Opposites were paired so that scalar contrasts were viewed simultaneously and stated consecutively (e.g. ``Here is a small teddy bear. Here is a big teddy bear.'').  Sample images are presented in Figure \ref{fig:book_demo}.

\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Procedure}

The procedures were identical to Experiment 1 except for the addition of reading the Alternatives Pre-Exposure book prior to test. Children were told that they would be
reading two books in the experimental session. The experimenter read the opposites book with children, labeling each picture in a neutral way on each page before reading the test book. As in Experiment 1, contrastive prosody was used for all adjectives in the Pre-Exposure book and in the test trials.


\subsection{Results and discussion}

Contrast selections were still difficult for children, but congruent with our hypothesis, the alternatives pre-exposure appeared to boost performance somewhat. Although the test trials were identical as in Experiment 1, children in Experiment 2 were above chance at both ages ($t(23) = 2.33$, $p = .03$ and $t(23) = 6.33$, $p < .0001$), aggregating across adjective types. Breaking down by adjective types, the younger 4s were above chance for feature but not size adjectives ($t(23) = 4.51$, $p = .0001$ and $t(23)=0$, $p = 1$). Older children were above chance on both ($t(23) = 8.31$, $p < .0001$ and $t(23)= 2.07$, $p = .05$). Nevertheless, no pairwise tests between the Experiments 1 and 2 reached significance, so we interpret these results with caution. 

We next analyzed our results using a logistic mixed model that included all interactions of age, adjective type, and experiment (1 or 2) but found that no effects reached significance, and this model did not increase fit over a model that only included main effects ($\chi^2(4) = 2.47$, $p = .65$). The main-effects only model included a significant effect of adjective type such that children made fewer contrast selections on size trials than feature trials ($\beta = -1.08$, $p < .0001$). It also included marginal effects of age and experiment ($\beta = 1.04$, $p = .07$ and $\beta = .50$, $p = .09$, respectively), indicating that older children performed better than younger children, and that performance was higher in the Experiment 2 than Experiment 1. 

The results from Experiment 2 indicate that contrast inferences were still challenging for children, but they show some sensitivity to identifying a dimension of contrast from adjective use. Performance was above chance for older children in some trial types, suggesting that this inference was still possible for them.  We also saw some signs that pre-exposure to a storybook that used the target adjectives contrastively improved performance, providing additional support to the idea that increasing the recognition of pragmatic contrasts helped children to make the appropriate generalization. We next wanted to investigate whether making implied contrast information more salient would help boost their ability to infer property variability with other category members. 




\section{Experiment 3}

In Experiment 3, we wanted to test preschoolers' ability to make contrast selections when we supported their inferences by  making implied alternatives more salient. We reran the same procedure as in Experiment 1, with the single manipulation that we included a stronger contrastive linguistic framing: instead of merely introducing a novel item and describing it using a prenominal adjective (e.g. ``This is a zib. This is a tall zib,'), in Experiment 3 we marked that it was ``a special of'' category member (e.g. ``This is a \emph{special kind of} zib. This is a tall zib'').  If children are sensitive to property variability conveyed by prenominal adjectives but had difficulty making contrast inferences from these word choices alone Experiments 1 and 2, they might be more likely to demonstrate contrast selections when the context provides greater pragmatic support in Experiment 3 .



\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

We expanded our age range to both 3- and 4-year-olds to examine the development of children's contrast inferences with supportive linguistic framing. We recruited a planned sample of 96 children into four age groups: 3.0--3.5 years (n=24, mean age 3;3, 11 girls, 13 boys), 3.5--4.0 years (n=24, mean age 3;9, 8 girls, 16 boys), 4.0--4.5 years (n=24, mean age 4;3, 12 girls, 12 boys), and 4.5--5.0 years (n=24, mean age 4;8, 14 girls, 10 boys).  Approximately half of the sample was recruited from the university preschool (n=52) and half was recruited from a local children's museum (n=44); recruitment location was roughly even across age groups. Children from the nursery school and the museum were demographically similar in terms of language exposure, ethnic backgrounds, and parental education, as reported by parents from each location. Samples from both locations were mainly composed of educated, Caucasian, middle class families. We tested for effect of location, and found no differences.

At the museum, parents accompanied their children and were asked to fill out a short demographic form about the child's language background. As a pre-specified selection criterion, only children who were reported to hear English at least 75\% of the time were included in the final sample.  Eight participants were excluded from analysis based on this criterion.\footnote{In our partnership with the museum, we invite any interested visitors to participate in our studies rather than prescreening children to meet our language requirements or to counterbalance all demographic factors \cite{callanan2012}. }  An additional two participants were excluded due to interruptions from family members during the testing session, and two were excluded for not completing all four experimental trials. 


We also ran a group of 128 adult participants on MTurk.  All participants were reported to be US residents and native English speakers.  They were informed that the task was designed for children. Three were excluded for failing to complete the task. 


\subsubsection{Materials}

Materials were identical to Experiment 1.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

Procedures were identical to Experiment 1, with the only difference that the induction shape was introduced as a ``special kind of'' that category member.

Preschoolers' ability to make correct contrast inferences increased across the age range we tested (Figure \ref{fig:experiments1thru4}).% \url{http://github.com/ahorowit/aliens}.
%We categorized a response as correct---representing what we will call a \emph{contrast inference}---if participants selected the item that differed from the exemplar along the referenced dimension (e.g., they chose the short item if the exemplar was referred as ``tall,'' and the clean item if it was described as ``dirty'').  
The youngest children in our sample (age 3.0--3.5 years) were marginally above chance ($t(23) = 1.84$, $p = .08$) in their contrast inferences across adjective types, and all other age groups were above chance (all $p$s $< .01$).


%The youngest children in our sample were numerically above chance in their responding across categories ($M=.61$) but were only marginally above chance, consolidating across adjective types ($t(23) = 1.84$, $p = .08$). All other groups were above chance (all $p$s $< .01$). 

To measure differences across adjective types and age groups, we used a logistic mixed effect model, predicting correct responses as the interaction of age and contrast type, with random intercept and slope (reflecting contrast type) for each participant. Children made increasingly more correct contrast judgments with age ($\beta = 1.52$, $p < .0001$). There was no significant effect of contrast type (feature vs. size adjectives), and no interaction between age and contrast type, suggesting that participants across ages did not differ in their responses to different property types.  

These results indicate that preschoolers are sensitive to adjectives as conveying contrast information about a relevant property dimension, at least in cases where many convergent cues signal the need for contrast (e.g., the ``special kind of'' framing, prosodic focus, and the structure of the test question that asks what category members are ``usually'' like in the context of a contrasting alternative). And even with the support of these cues, the inference that we tested was still challenging: children needed to comprehend the modified noun phrase, recognize that it was being used contrastively---though this aspect of the inference was most supported---and then select the item that \emph{differed} from the named property (rather than selecting the visual match). Despite these demands, preschoolers overall performed remarkably well on the task. Our next experiments investigate contrast inferences when the presence of cues supporting contrast is varied.

% Rather than selecting the image that matched the named property, adults and children both selected the contrasting property.  


% Adults had no difficulty inferring contrast from adjective use in our task, and preschoolers showed a developmental increase in performance before reaching that of adults by age 5.  



\section{Experiment 4} 

Experiments 1 -- 3 show that preschoolers can infer the appropriate dimension of contrast from the presence of an adjective. In these experiments, however, children's performance could have been an artifact of the particular modifier terms we used, which tended to convey marked, atypical properties. For example, children might have heard ``dirty'' and responded that other category members tend to be clean due to a baseline assumption that cleanliness is a more common, default state (rather than due to having made a contrast inference per se). In Experiment 4, we ran another iteration of the experiment that fully counterbalanced adjective references across both ends of the opposite scales. Instead of comparing only one of a pair of feature or size terms---``dirty'' vs. ``tall''---we also included trials containing references to their opposites---``clean'' vs. ``short.''  As a result of this design choice, we also included eight (rather than four) trials per child, increasing our overall statistical power.
% Children's responses remained above chance in their version of the experiment, suggesting that their performance is reflecting sensitivity to pragmatic implications of word choice generally rather than base rate assumptions about property states.

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

We recruited a new planned sample of 48 children in two age groups: 4.0--4.5 years (n=24, mean age 4;3, 12 girls, 12 boys), and 4.5--5.0 years (n=24, mean age 4;8, 12 girls, 12 boys).  Half of the sample for each age group was recruited from the university preschool and half was recruited from the children's museum.

\subsubsection{Materials}

Stimuli were combined from---and mostly identical to---those used in Experiments 1--3, with some minor modifications. The stimulus set was composed of eight experimental trials.  Each trial depicted a unique, nameable feature opposite pair (\emph{dirty---clean, wet---dry, pointy---round, hot---cold. dark---bright, open---closed, soft---hard,} and \emph{full---empty}). Four size pairs (\emph{big---small, tall---short, fat---skinny, long---short}) were used twice across the test set, with each term represented as an exemplar once per participant.  
%Each test trial featured a unique feature contrast: \emph{dirty---clean, wet---dry, pointy---round, hot---cold. dark---bright, open---closed, soft---hard,} and \emph{full---empty}.  

\subsubsection{Procedure}

The procedure was identical to Experiment 1. Children participated in 8 trials, however, which were counterbalanced by list order, adjective type (feature vs. size), polarity of the opposite term (e.g. ``dirty,'' ``clean,'' ``tall,'' or ``short''), and target location. All adjectives were prosodically focused using contrastive stress. 

\subsection{Results and discussion}

Overall, performance in Experiment 4 was similar to the Experiment 1 (Figure \ref{fig:experiments1thru4}). 
Both younger and older 4s were reliably above chance ($t(23) = 3.05$, $p<.01$ and $t(24) = 3.99$, $p<.001$, respectively). Younger 4s made contrast selections reliably above chance in size trials ($t(23)=3.44$, $p<.01$) and marginally above chance for feature trials ($t(23)=1.73$, $p=0.09$). Older 4s showed a slightly different pattern, selecting the contrast reliably on feature trials ($t(24)=5.32$, $p<.0001$) but at chance for size trials ($t(24)=1.56$, $p=.13$). To quantify this pattern of responses, we ran a logistic mixed effect model predicting correct responses as an interaction of contrast type and age, with random slope (reflecting contrast type) for each participant.  A marginal effect of adjective type emerged, such that children made more contrast selections for size than feature trials overall ($\beta = 7.69$, $p = .09$). There was also a marginally significant interaction between trial type and age, indicating that contrast selections for size trials decreased with age ($\beta = -1.85$, $p = .08$). These findings by and large replicate the findings of Experiment 1 and indicate that preschoolers are sensitive to adjective use generally, regardless of whether or not the adjective conveys a marked, atypical property.






\section{Experiment 5} 

In Experiment 5, we tested the extent of children's contrast inferences by examining their performance in a free-response task. One possible interpretation of Experiments 1--4 is that children might not be making  contrast inferences immediately, but they recognize that such an inference is required by the two-alternative forced-choice format of the experiment. A free response task circumvents this issue by testing children's interpretation of the concept without asking them to choose between alternatives. For the linguistic framing in this experiment, we chose an intermediate level of support for contrast; more supportive than Experiments 1 and 2, but less extreme than Experiment 3: we told children that ``This is a plizzle. There are different kinds of plizzles. This one is a small plizzle.'' 

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

We recruited a new planned sample of 24 4-year-old children (mean age 4;6, 12 girls, 12 boys) from the local children's museum.  Two children whose parents reported that they heard English less than 75\% of the time were excluded in the final sample, and one participant was excluded for not producing responses to the experimenter's questions.

\subsubsection{Materials}

We used a similar design as Experiments 1--4, but showed children only a single picture rather than a triad.  In addition, because some of the original items depicted contrasts in which one pole was visually salient but perhaps difficult for children to name (e.g. ``broken'' vs. ``unbroken''), we used test items in which both ends of the opposite scale were namable as in Experiment 3. The named size contrasts used were \emph{small} (vs. big), \emph{tall} (vs. short), \emph{long} (vs. short), and \emph{skinny} (vs. fat).  The named feature contrasts were \emph{hot} (vs. cold), \emph{dark} (vs. bright), \emph{wet} (vs. dry), and \emph{open} (vs. closed).  We also included a post-test to ensure that children were familiar with all of the properties used in the task.  Children successfully identified pictures that corresponded with the meanings of the adjectives in 96\% of trials.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

The experimenter read the storybook with children individually in a quiet room at the museum. As before, children were introduced to Allen the Alien and then given two training trials with familiar items. Unlike in  Experiments 1--4, children saw only a single image per trial. For example, in a training trial, children were shown a picture of a heart-shaped cookie and told, ``This is a cookie.  There are different kinds of cookies.  This one is a heart-shaped cookie.  What do other cookies look like?'' Most children answered immediately that most cookies are \emph{round} or \emph{circle}-shaped. A few children were slower to respond, and were promoted to think again what most cookies look like. If they still did not respond, they were asked what shape most cookies are.  If children provided an answer other than shape, they were given the description again.
 % (e.g. ``You're right, cookies can be different flavors. Did you see this one is heart-shaped?  What do most cookies look like?''). 

Following the two training trials, children participated in four test trials in which they were shown a picture of a single exemplar and told something about it, e.g. ``Wow, this is a plizzle. There are different kinds of plizzles. This one is a small plizzle.  What do you think other plizzles look like?'' Their verbal responses were recorded.  Two of the test trials referred to size adjectives (e.g. \emph{small}), and two of the trials referred to feature adjectives (e.g. \emph{hot}).  The order of trial items varied across two lists, each of which was counterbalanced for adjective type and picture order.  Adjectives were focused using contrastive stress. Responses were coded online and double-coded offline using a video recording of the testing session.  The task took about ten minutes to complete. 

\subsection{Results and discussion}

\begin{figure}[t] 
  \begin{center} 
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/expt3.pdf} 
    \caption{\label{fig:freeResponse} Four-year-olds' free response descriptions of other category members upon hearing a feature adjective (left) or size adjective (right).

Error bars show 95\% confidence intervals. }
  \end{center} 
\vspace{-10ex}
\end{figure}

Despite the open-ended nature of the task, children gave contrastive responses more than half of the time (57\% and 64\% overall for feature and size, Figure \ref{fig:freeResponse}).  We coded responses as either an \emph{Exact contrast} (e.g. hearing ``small'' and saying ``big'') or as an \emph{Other contrasting term} if they were an approximate contrast to the named property (e.g. hearing ``small'' and saying a size property other than ``big'', e.g. ``tall''). Matching, non-contrastive descriptions (e.g. hearing ``small'' and repeating ``small'') were not included in the approximate contrast group. More than a third of productions were exact opposites (35\% for feature terms and 39\% for size terms), and another quarter were non-exact contrasts but related to the stated property information (22\% for feature terms and 25\% for size terms). There were no differences in the proportion of response scores across feature and size trials. Thus, Experiment 5 provides evidence that, even without seeing a contrastive alternative test item, children were able to spontaneously generate appropriate descriptions based on the adjective the speaker used. 
% These results suggest that children can consider possible contrastive implications from word choice cues, and the presence of the visual alternatives in the previous experiments may even have dampened their performance. The forced-choice design in our previous studies may have made it more cognitively taxing for children for children to hold their inferences in mind and inhibit the impulse to select the named property.

\section{General Discussion}

If a speaker references a ``salad fork,'' can children learn that there are other types of forks? And if they hear someone described as a ``female scientist'' or ``male librarian,'' will they make (potentially harmful) inferences about gender-typical roles? Our findings support the idea that children are indeed sensitive to contrasts of this type. In our experiments, they were able to learn from not just the literal content of a speaker's utterance, but from the choices she made in expressing that content; they inferred property variability from modified noun phrases.

In Experiment 1, preschoolers reliably made contrast inferences from size and feature adjectives with the support of a contrastive linguistic framing.  In Experiment 2, we found that unlike adults, 4-year-olds had difficulty making these inferences when the supportive framing was removed. Their performance increased somewhat after exposure to the relevant adjective contrasts, however, suggesting that a number of cues to the contrastiveness of a particular adjective could contribute to their ability to make inferences. Experiment 3 ruled out an explanation with respect to the markedness or typicality of the particular properties we used in Experiments 1 and 2. And in Experiment 4, which used a free-response task, 4-year-olds were able to generate the relevant property contrasts (without seeing them pictured in the two-alternative-forced choice we used in the other experiments). Taken together, our results suggest that preschoolers can reason about speakers' adjective choices as providing information not only about the particular entity being described at the time, but also about other category members. 

Although the design of our task was simple, it nevertheless required children to make a counterintuitive response to the descriptions they heard: inferring that their opposite was typical of a broader category and suppressing a simple perceptual match. This finding is congruent with previous work suggesting that preschoolers make similar inferences in their causal reasoning \cite{harris1996} as well as in their pragmatic use of language \cite{barner2011,stiller2014}. Our task may have been particularly challenging because the paradigm was so contextually minimal, introducing each test trial with a single referential expression. Nevertheless, preschoolers were still largely able to process the adjective and then select the picture that \emph{differed} from that description instead of the one that shared that property, even though both options were available. Performance was stronger for older children across experiments, however. Because of the inhibitory demands of the task, changes in executive function during the preschool years provide a plausible source for these developmental effects \cite{davidson2006,zelazo2003}. 

%inferring that their opposite was representative of a broader category. In other words, children needed to process the stated adjective and then select the picture that \emph{differed} from that description instead of the one that shared that property, even though both picture options were available. 


% The task thus involved both pragmatic reasoning about how people use language, and also the exercise of executive function in inhibiting the bias to match the description directly at test.  We found that preschoolers nonetheless made contrast inferences, 

Our data speak to children's ability to learn one particular piece of information from pragmatic language use: the typical property for exemplars of a category. We selected this example because the generalization of category structure from individual exemplars is a key problem for children \cite{markman1991}. To test this effect experimentally, we asked children what they thought category members \emph{usually} look like, specifically querying inferences about typicality. But there is a broader variety of inferences that could be made on the basis of the same sort of optional modification. As in the case of ``salad fork,'' sometimes a contrastive modifier does not license specific inferences about what is typical of a category (if ``salad'' does not have an opposite, what can we infer about other forks?). Instead, the modifier licenses the inference that there is some important variability along a dimension (there are forks purposed for non-salad things). 

The pragmatic and discourse context of an utterance can also affect the kind of inference that is licensed by a contrastive modifier. Depending on context, labeling someone as a ``good student'' can imply that others in the comparison set are either better (where the student is implied to be ``merely good'') or worse (where the student is ``very good''). Our results suggest that preschoolers are sensitive to property variability conveyed by adjective use, and future work should investigate the broader range of inferences---from other kinds of world knowledge to the idiosyncrasies of social judgement---that are sometimes licensed by adjective use. And in addition to adjectives, many other optional choices that speakers make in their utterances can convey implicit information about the world; consider what is implied about the world by optional modifier phrases like ``a car without a transmission'' (cars usually have transmissions) or ``a politician who thinks that more spending isn't the answer'' (generally, politicians endorse more spending---or at least the speaker thinks this is the case). 

 % convey pragmatic information a speaker's intention or the context supporting their production choices. For example, using a less expected word choice (``rush'' instead of ``go'') or a longer description (``I got the car to start'' vs. ``I started the car'') can also convey contrast with other possible meanings \cite{horn1984}. Adjectives may thus be only one type of descriptive cue children use to learn about the world.


In addition to identifying a method for learning about the world, our experiments also contribute to the growing literature suggesting that children consider how and why evidence is generated to reason about the social world, in both non-linguistic and linguistic contexts. As reviewed above, even young children robustly infer probabilities from random sampling while making inferences about social preferences or generalizable knowledge from conspicuous non-random sampling \cite{xu2009, kushnir2010, butler2012}. In the domain of language, preschoolers are beginning to make similar (pragmatic) inferences about the motivations for language use \cite<e.g.>{stiller2014,katsos2011}, though many factors may constrain their ability to succeed in more complex situations \cite{papafragou2003,barner2011}. 

The \emph{alternatives hypothesis}---that children's ability to make inferences is often constrained by their ability to bring to mind and contrast the relevant inferential alternatives---has been proposed to explain children's failures in some tests of pragmatic reasoning \cite{chierchia2001,barner2011}. In the case of scalar implicature, these alternatives can be quantifiers like ``some'' and ``all''; in our case, they were pairs of polar adjectives. In both cases, the pragmatic inference is supported by an appreciation of what \emph{wasn't} said. Our pre-exposure manipulation in Experiment 2 provides some preliminary evidence that the alternatives hypothesis explains children's difficulty in our task. An additional previous study with color adjectives also supports this hypothesis \cite{horowitz2012}. Four-year-olds in this study were considerably more proficient in making contrast inferences with size terms than with colors, which may result because color terms lack of an obvious alternative: While a ``\emph{small} zib'' might be exceptional relative to the larger, more typical zibs, a ``\emph{red} zib'' less clearly implies what the color of other zibs (other than not being red). 
% Although the stimuli in this earlier experiment were different than those used in the current study and hence direct numerical comparisons between levels of performance are not possible, it nevertheless provides additional circumstantial evidence about the role of pragmatic alternatives in allowing such inferences. 


% The free response results in Experiment 4 give further support to the hypothesis that children might be making more spontaneous contrast inferences than we can see in their forced choice responses, since the forced choice task includes the inhibitory demand of selecting between a visual match and a visual competitor.

Most work investigating children's pragmatic abilities has focused on reasoning about speakers' intended meanings. In contrast, we examined children's inferences about the state of the world that would lead a speaker to make particular production choices. While preschoolers show evidence of learning generalizable knowledge from specific descriptions based on framing cues \cite{cimpian2009}, our work suggests an additional pragmatic route to such general knowledge. In this way, we connect the mechanisms of pragmatic inference with processes of social learning and generalization. If children assume that speakers are communicating pragmatically, then they can take advantage of opportunities for learning wherever they recognize a speaker's choice to produce an utterance in one form over another.
